# Coomi Rust

Coomi is the Rust agent engine extracted from
[Coomi-Android](https://github.com/TensorHub-ORG/Coomi-Android). It is a compact
terminal coding agent organized as six workspace layers.

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `engine` | Agent loop, canonical messages, tool lifecycle, sessions, project instructions |
| `services` | Provider registry and OpenAI-compatible, Responses, Anthropic, and Gemini adapters |
| `tools` | File reading/writing/editing, search, and shell execution |
| `security` | Workspace boundaries, access profiles, destructive-command policy |
| `ui` | Interactive terminal, non-interactive execution, model and session commands |
| `catalogs` | Built-in installable MCP and Skill catalogs |

Installed Skills are exposed to the agent through `list_skills` and
`read_skill`, so full instructions are loaded only when a task needs them.

## Building

Requires the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (install with
`rustup`, or use `rustup toolchain install` matching the file).

```bash
cargo build --release --bin coomi
./target/release/coomi --help
```

Cross-compile a statically linked binary for aarch64 (Termux/Android arm64-v8a):

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl --bin coomi
```

The `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` target needs a matching cross C toolchain only
when a dependency compiles C code; this project's dependency set is pure Rust
(requwest uses rustls-tls), so no C compiler is required in practice.

## Provider configuration

Models are loaded exclusively from `~/.coomi/config/providers.json` (or
`$COOMI_HOME/config/providers.json`). Both `model` and `fast_model` are exposed
by `coomi models`; arbitrary model overrides are rejected.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "active": "my-provider",
  "providers": {
    "my-provider": {
      "type": "openai_compatible",
      "display": "My Provider",
      "api_key": "...",
      "base_url": "https://example.com/v1",
      "model": "main-model",
      "fast_model": "fast-model",
      "context_window": 256000,
      "effective_context_window_percent": 95,
      "auto_compact_scope": "total",
      "supports_web_search": false,
      "supports_vision": false
    }
  }
}
```

Supported provider types are `openai_compatible`, `openai_responses`,
`anthropic_messages`, and `gemini_native`. The legacy value `generic` maps to
`openai_compatible`.

Provider API keys remain plain text in `providers.json`. Settings masks them by
default and allows temporary reveal with `V`; it does not claim to encrypt the
file. OpenAI Responses providers can opt into trigger-based remote compaction with
`"supports_remote_compaction": true` and
`"remote_compaction_mode": "v2"`. Set the mode to `"legacy"` only for a
provider that implements `/responses/compact` instead of `compaction_trigger`.

## Context management

Coomi uses provider usage as the context baseline and estimates local changes
incrementally. Tool calls remain paired with outputs, oversized outputs are
trimmed before old history, and real user
messages are retained around a compacted checkpoint. Context-window errors also
trigger one compaction and retry.

Automatic compaction is adaptive. Its default ceiling is 90% of the model's
declared context window, bounded by the effective context window and optionally
lowered by `auto_compact_token_limit`. It is therefore not a separate mechanism
that waits blindly for a UI meter to reach 90%. Use `body_after_prefix` for
providers whose reusable prefix should be excluded from the compaction counter.
Use `/compact` to run the same compactor immediately.

## Commands

```text
coomi
coomi exec "inspect this repository"
coomi models
coomi sessions
coomi resume --last
coomi compact --last
coomi catalog list mcp
coomi catalog list skill
coomi catalog install mcp filesystem --set allowed_path=F:\Projects\Demo
coomi catalog install skill frontend-design
```

Running `coomi` or an interactive `coomi resume` opens the full-screen terminal
interface. It keeps the conversation timeline, tool progress, queued follow-ups,
and multiline composer visible together. Use `Ctrl+K` for the command palette,
`Ctrl+R` for workspace session history, `Alt+M` for configured models, `Alt+S`
for Settings, and `Alt+H` for the complete key reference. `Alt+L` opens or edits
the active Loop, `Alt+Enter` starts a read-only Side Session, `Shift+Tab` cycles
the access policy, and `Esc` cancels an active turn. No F1-F12 binding is used.

Typing `/` opens the command picker. The main control commands are `/status`,
`/compact`, `/model`, `/history`, `/loop`, `/plan`, `/memory`, `/mcp`, `/skills`,
`/settings`, `/catalog`, `/new`, `/clear`, and `/quit`. Approval prompts and user
questions are bottom sheets directly above the composer, not centered dialogs.
Assistant output is rendered as Markdown, including headings, lists, tables,
links, code spans, and fenced code blocks. The footer shows active context usage.

## Runtime capabilities

The built-in tool surface includes `local_shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`,
`edit_file`, `apply_patch`, `list_dir`, `grep_files`, `web_search`, `view_image`,
`request_user_input`, `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, `close_agent`, and
`update_plan`, plus Loop, Memory, Skill, process, and configured MCP tools.
Provider-native web search replaces the local fallback when declared. Image tool
results use native multimodal content for Responses, Chat Completions, Anthropic,
and Gemini instead of placing Base64 in ordinary text.

Busy-turn input is accepted into the active model/tool loop at the next model or
tool boundary. Memory, Hooks, Side Sessions, automatic pasted Provider/MCP/Skill
configuration, startup update checks, installable catalogs, and keyboard-only
Settings are available in the first interactive session.

The default `workspace-write` policy allows file edits inside the selected
working directory and asks before arbitrary shell commands. `read-only` blocks
writes; `full-access` expands the path boundary but still asks before commands
recognized as destructive unless `--yes` is explicitly supplied.
